> Multi-platform over-the-air installation aggregator (a TestFlight alternative).

Yolo is one-stop realtime feed of ready-to-install releases and tests for your apps. We're using it at [berty](https://github.com/berty) to make releases and test branches ready to download and use on a developer's device within minutes after passing our CI.

We created Yolo to implement the critical features missing from Apple's TestFlight.
